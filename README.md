# Eggelbert

Eggelbert is a complete rebuild of a game from my childhood, but with Godot and 3D models.
The 3D models are being recreated from scratch by myself using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## WIP

This game is a work in progress, and will probably never be finished.

## Running a Copy

In order to run a copy, you must have [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (with Mono) and [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.
Simply clone the repository, open the project under the `godot` folder, and run.
