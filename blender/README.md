# Eggelbert (Blender files)

This folder contains the `.blend` (Blender) 3D models.

In order to avoid storing these large binary blobs in Git, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used.
As such, these files are not the actual models, but instead are *pointers* to the actual binary blob.
In order to get the actual files, Git LFS must be installed locally on your computer *before* cloning this repository.
